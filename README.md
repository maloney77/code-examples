# code-examples
Just a few assignments I have worked on in different classes

The C# program was an assignment that pulled out information from a database and displayed it onto a form. It may not run properly without
some sort of visual studios installed so I provided a text version of just the code to be read.

The java program is moreso a javaFX program. This one takes in inputs for two triangles and outputs the triangles to the screen and then
outputs whether they are inside eachother, not connected, touching, and so on.

The two C++ programs are pretty simplistic but show how I code a bit. maxflowalgor is a program that implements the max flow algorithm
finding the best flow through a single point in a graph more can be read about this here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_flow_problem.

The other C++ program is a pretty simplistic lexical analyzer from scratch. A user inputs a string and it looks to see if that string matches
certain criteria and outputs what it is like an email, scientific notation number, a string, and others.
